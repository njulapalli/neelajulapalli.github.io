                Investigating key considerations for a small farmer starting a backyard farm business in Saratoga
                County, NY. Data Analyses were performed using various USDA and weather websites processing data for
                prices of
                various crops, yield of farms in various geographical locations,
                cost differential of organic vs conventional to name a few to identify potential crops to maximize
                profit for farmers in Saratoga County.

                The purpose of this project was to analyze how weather changes as you get closer to the equator. To
                accomplish this analysis, we first pulled data from the OpenWeatherMap API to assemble a dataset on
                over 500 cities.
